### Comments to grader:

	The main changes I introduced to the code were:
	
	- A constructor that accepts strings as arguments.
	- A constructor that accepts a single integer to represent fractions of type a/1
	- I created several extension methods to display the logic of the basic + - / * that can be performed on rational numbers.

### Feedback to student:
